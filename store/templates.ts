        question: "What's the difference between light and dark roast coffee?",
        answer: "Light roast coffee is roasted for less time, preserving more of the bean's original flavor characteristics and caffeine content. It typically has a brighter, more acidic taste with floral or fruity notes. Dark roast coffee is roasted longer, creating a bolder, more intense flavor with notes of chocolate or caramel, and a less acidic taste. While many believe dark roast has more caffeine, it actually has slightly less than light roast."
